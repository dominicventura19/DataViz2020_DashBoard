# Objective
Create a Dashboard (you don’t need to include a sidebar if you don’t have any functionality for it in mind) that has two boxes: One showing a map corresponding to 
the areas in your .csv file and displaying the information that the statistic refers to (i.e., a map of Florida with country specific COVID-19 cases), 
and a second box that shows the .csv file as a DataTable or an Rhandsontable. Publish your dashboard on shinyapps.io
